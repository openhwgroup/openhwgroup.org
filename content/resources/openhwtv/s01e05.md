Back in June, the first episode of OpenHW TV looked at the CORE-V Verification Test Bench and our open-source RISC-V processor IP design verification plan. Just 4 months on and OpenHW Group is approaching the Functional RTL Freeze milestone for the CVE4. This episode looks at what the Functional RTL Freeze milestone means and how learnings from our early verification efforts have shaped our test bench progress, highlighting bugs and coverage gaps to help us deliver commercial grade, industrial quality verification work. Presenters include the Verification Task Group leadership team as well as key members of the OpenHW Group ecosystem who have collaborated to build our industry quality, coverage driven CORE-V Verification Test Bench.
