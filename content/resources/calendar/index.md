All the OpenHW Foundation [Working Group Calls](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=meetings@openhwgroup.org) 
are managed through a single shared Google calendar.  

You can find a web version of this shared calendar below.

The shared calendar is also available in [iCal format](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/meetings%40openhwgroup.org/public/basic.ics), 
which is compatible with most desktop calendar clients.
